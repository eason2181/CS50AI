# CS50AI-degrees
---
This is my implementation of Harvard University online course CS50AI project0: degrees. Full description can be found here: <http://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/degrees/>  
In this project I used BFS to search for one (out of possibly many) shortest connection from one actor to another through their movies.
